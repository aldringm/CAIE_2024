THE SIMULATION CODE WAS WRITTEN IN PYTHON LANGUAGE, VERSION 3.7.0. THE PACKAGES USED WERE PANDAS, NUMPY, MATPLOTLIB, AND GUROBIPY. TO EXECUTE THE PYTHON CODES IS NECESSARY A GUROBI LICENSE.
FIRSTLY, A DIRECTORY FOR SAVING THE INPUT AND ANOTHER TO SAVE THE OUTPUT FILES SHOULD BE CREATED. THEN, IT IS NECESSARY TO INDICATE THESE DIRECTORY PATHS IN LINES 6 AND 7 OF THE FILE MAIN_INPUT.py.
THE SIMULATION PARAMETERS ARE SET IN LINES 10 TO 16 OF THE CODE FILE MAIN_INPUT.py.

IT IS SHOWN ABOVE THE INPUT FILES, THE CODE PYTHON FILES, AND THE OUTPUT FILES.

THE FILES PRESENTED IN THIS REPOSITORY ARE GROUPED INTO THREE CATEGORIES.
THE FIRST CATEGORY IS THE INPUT FILES, WHICH ARE SAVED IN THE DIRECTORY INPUT
THE SECOND CATEGORY IS THE MODULE FILES, WHICH ARE SAVED IN THE ROOT.
THE THIRD CATEGORY IS THE OUTPUT FILES, WHICH ARE GENERATED DURING THE EXECUTION OF THE SIMULATION.

  2 - Input_LoaderMachine.csv : THIS FILE CONTAINS THE MAIN PARAMETERS OF THE LOADING MACHINES.
  3 - Input_Discharge.csv : THIS FILE CONTAINS THE MAIN PARAMETERS OF THE DISCHARGES.
  4 - Input_OrePlant.csv : THIS FILE CONTAINS THE MAIN PARAMETERS OF THE ORE PROCESSING PLANTS.

#PYTHON CODE FILES:
  1 - MAIN_INPUT.py : THIS IS THE MAIN FILE; ONCE EXECUTED, THE INTERFACE_CONTROLL.py WILL BE CALLED TO START THE SIMULATION PROCESS.
  2 - INTERFACE_CONTROLL.py : FILE THAT CONTROLS THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE MILP-SOVLER (OPTIMIZER.py) AND THE SIMULATION FUNCTIONS (SIMULATOR.py).
  3 - SIMULATOR.py : FILE THAT CONTAINS ALL SIMULATION FUNCTIONS.
  4 - OPTIMIZER.py: FILE THAT CONTAINS THE MILP MODEL CODED IN GUROBY.

#OUTUPT FILES:
  1 - Trips[replication number].txt : EACH ROW SHOWS THE START OF A TRUCK TRIP, THE MMU, THE MATERIAL HAULAGE, THE DISCHARGE POINT, AND THE PAYLOAD.
  2 - TruckeEvents[replication number].txt : EACH ROW DESCRIBES A TRUCK EVENT.
  3 - OrePiles[replication number].txt EACH ROWN SHOWS THE PARAMETERS VALUES OF A FORMED PILE (DISCHARGE, ELEMENT GRADES, SIZE PARTICLE, RECLAIMED RATE)
